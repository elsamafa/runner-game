# Runner

## Description
Brief description of the project

This is a simple runner game. The player has to make the character dodge the (objects) that come to him/her by jumping with the spacebar. In case of touching one of the (objects), the game is over and the score is the number of seconds the game has lasted. 

## MVP (DOM - CANVAS)
MVP definition, deliverables.

CANVAS - Since there are no levels, the MVP will have three basic screens: the splash screen, the game screen with basic geometric shapes, where the player avoid them by jumping and a game over screen with the final score would appear.

## Backlog

- SVG Pictures (background, character, objects)
- Music
- Double jump by tapping the spacebar twice
- Build objects with different size (height / width)
- Increase the objects' velocity
